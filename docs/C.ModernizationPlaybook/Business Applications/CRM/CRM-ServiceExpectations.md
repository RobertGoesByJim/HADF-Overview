# Service Expectations

While Service Level Agreements (SLAs) may exist between the Government of British Columbia and service providers who ensure underlying infrastructure continues to meet expectations, generally no formal service level agreements have been established for solution platforms, or software procured through the OCIO.  Now there may be an opportunity to determine roles, responsibilities, and expectations of both the OCIO and consuming ministry business organizations associated with the procurement, licensing, implementation, customizaion, deployment, maintenance, and support of largely off-the-shelf software and software-as-a-service.  With respect to CRM, and the current four qualified suppliers, this section seeks to pose (if not currently answer) questions like: 
- Who deals with vendors?
- who negotiates agreements?  Will there be more than one, or more than one type, of agreement?
- How do I get licenses to use product x?  How quickly can I get them?
- What kind of approvals are required prior to procuring my licenses?
- who performs those approvals, and what prequalification process must I accomplish?
- Is there someone who can help me determine an approach to my CRM problem?
- How do I know that my business opportunity can be addressed with CRM?
- I am having challenges with integrations to other systems - who do I call?
-
